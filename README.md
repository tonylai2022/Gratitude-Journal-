## Inspiration
I created Gratitude Journal because I believe that being thankful can have a big impact on our lives. Depression has been rising steadily in recent years. I wanted to make it simple for people to write about things they are grateful for every day and boost their mental health.

## What it does
Gratitude Journal is a simple app for your phone or computer. It helps you write about things that make you happy or grateful. You can write in your journal every day, and feel good about the positive things in your life.

## How I built it
I built Gratitude Journal using basic web tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Bootstrap 5.0 for my frontend library. I also used Firebase 8.0 as my BAAS(Backend as a Service). I focused on making it a mobile-first app so everyone can use it on the phone easily.

## Challenges I faced
Creating Gratitude Journal was not easy. I had the following challenges:

### Connect firebase database
I had to fix the authentication problem to let user to login after register, instead of making a new account every time.

### Create DOM to save users' journal
I had to figure out how to store users' input in the database and display it in the correct section. 

### Create DOM to change font size and color
I had to synchronize the changes on the settings page to all other pages with DOM. 

## Accomplishments I am proud of
I am proud that I created a simple app that helps people focus on positive thoughts. Building a place where users can write about what makes them happy was a significant achievement for me.

## What I learned
While making Gratitude Journal, I learned a lot about designing user-friendly apps. I also discovered how expressing gratitude can bring happiness.

## What's next for Gratitude Journal
In the future, I want to add more features to Gratitude Journal, such as allowing people to create their own categories and adding their own pictures. Also, I aim to make it even more user-friendly and help more individuals appreciate the good things in their lives.
